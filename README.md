# Swag Labs Software Testing Project

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to testing the Swag Labs demo e-commerce platform. The project aims to explore and implement different software testing methodologies to ensure the system's functionality, usability, and performance. As we progress, we will design test cases, automate testing processes, and document findings to enhance the overall shopping experience.

## Project Scope
Our focus will be on:

- Understanding the Swag Labs system
- Designing and executing test cases
- Implementing automated and manual testing approaches
- Identifying and reporting defects

More details, including the tech stack, test execution, and contribution guidelines, will be added as we advance in the project.
